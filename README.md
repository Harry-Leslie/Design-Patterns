# Design Patterns Repository

Welcome to the Java Design Patterns Repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of commonly used design patterns implemented in Java and Python. Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring software design problems that promote code reusability, maintainability, and scalability. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about design patterns or an experienced developer seeking to apply these patterns to your projects, this repository serves as a valuable resource.

## Contents

This repository contains a wide range of design patterns categorized into three main types:

### Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, attempting to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. In this repository, you'll find implementations of patterns like:

- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

### Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition, providing mechanisms to form larger structures from individual objects. You'll find implementations of patterns like:

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with the interaction between objects, providing solutions for communication and collaboration. This repository includes implementations of patterns like:

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

## How to Use

Each design pattern is implemented in a separate Java and Python file which are accompanied by a detailed explanation of the pattern's intent, structure, participants, and usage scenarios. You can explore the patterns individually or combine them to solve complex software design challenges. Simply navigate to the respective pattern's directory to access the Java code and associated documentation.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are highly encouraged! If you'd like to add a new design pattern implementation, improve existing code, or enhance documentation, feel free to submit a pull request. Please follow the established code formatting and documentation standards to maintain consistency across the repository.
