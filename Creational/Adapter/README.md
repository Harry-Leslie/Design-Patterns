# Adapter Design Pattern

The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two interfaces, allowing them to interact seamlessly.

## Problem Statement

In software development, you often encounter situations where existing classes or components have interfaces that are not compatible with each other. Integrating these components directly can be challenging and can lead to tight coupling. The Adapter Design Pattern provides a solution by introducing a new class that acts as an intermediary, translating one interface into another.

## Solution

The Adapter Design Pattern involves the following components:

1. **Target Interface:** This is the desired interface that the client code expects to work with.

2. **Adaptee:** This is the existing class or component with an incompatible interface.

3. **Adapter:** This is the new class that implements the target interface and contains an instance of the adaptee. It acts as a wrapper, translating calls from the target interface into calls to the adaptee's interface.

## Benefits
- Allows the integration of components with incompatible interfaces.
- Reduces tight coupling between classes.
- Provides a way to reuse existing code without modifying it.

## Use Cases
The Adapter Design Pattern is commonly used in scenarios such as:

- Integrating legacy code with modern systems.
- Working with third-party libraries or APIs with different interfaces.
- Creating a common interface for multiple similar but incompatible classes.

## Conclusion
The Adapter Design Pattern is a powerful tool for making existing code work seamlessly with new components that have different interfaces. By introducing an adapter, you can achieve loose coupling and maintainability while reusing and integrating existing code effectively.
